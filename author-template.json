With 41 years of coding experience and 25 years building startups, Jacob created IronBarcode to solve the complexity of barcode integration in .NET. His philosophy: barcode processing should require one line of code to read and one line to write. IronBarcode's automatic format detection, ML-powered error correction, and native PDF support reflect this commitment to developer simplicity. Jacob also created IronOCR (Tesseract for .NET) and IronPDF (Chromium-based PDF library), collectively serving over 10 million NuGet downloads.",
